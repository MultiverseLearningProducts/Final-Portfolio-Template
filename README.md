## Overview

During my time with Multiverse and American Express I have adapted the skills needed to become instrumental in application maintenance and management by implementing security for credentials used for application to application (A2A) authenticated secrets.

This repository is a collection of some of my key learnings during my 2022 - 2023 apprenticeship at American Express.
